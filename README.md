# Taming the Python - A Solution Engineer Running Workshop to Start Making Python Useful

Welcome to the running workshop on Python! This repository is intended to provide an introduction to Python and its ecosystem. We'll cover installation, overview of Python as a language, a program, and ecosystem for automation, data science, and much more. Select the links below to get started. 

# Introduction

Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively. You can learn to use Python and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs. (Python Software Foundation, 2019)

In GIS and many interdisciplinary fields, Python has grown in use tremendously, likely due to its ease of use, capabilities, and adoption of British humour and dad-jokes. 

Whether you are a GIS user, system administrator, data scientist, or aspiring singer, knowing at least a little bit about Python is key to your success. Let's go on this journey to tame the Python!

## What is Python?

### A Language

Python is a scripting and programming language with its own syntax, style-guide, and best practices. 

### A Program

Python is also an executable program that can run on your computer, on the cloud, or in your dreams if you've been scripting all day. At some point in your adventures you will see a Python.exe program (if on Windows). This program accepts arguments, which could be Python scripts. This program can also be installed a variety of ways, and comes in a plethora of applications. Ultimately, you need to know that in addition to writing Python code, you will also be running Python as a program.

### An Ecosystem

My favorite part of Python is the community and the overwhelming amount of functionality at your fingertips once you are acquainted with the basics. From determining the current date, to translating to any language, to performing advanced statistical analysis and data visualization, to running web servers, and everything in between those non-linear concepts: Python's got your back. Or better yet: the Python community's got your back. 

There are a tremendous amount of Python enthusiasts that are building Python tools and responding to questions on Stack Overflow. If you ever feel lonely, just give Python a try and you will soon feel the need to ask the Python community a question. Inevitably, you will land at other Python developers and people that strive to solve problems. 

## Why is Python?

"Python plays a key role in our production pipeline. Without it a project the size of Star Wars: Episode II would have been very difficult to pull off. From crowd rendering to batch processing to compositing, Python binds all things together," said Tommy Burnette, Senior Technical Director, Industrial Light & Magic.

## Where is Python?

Python can be installed in far too many ways. That's part of what makes it a bit confusing to get started... For example, all Macs come with Python. ArcGIS itself comes with Python, and ArcMap came with a different version of Python than ArcGIS Pro, which changed the rules for how to use it. There is also a Python executable that you can install directly from the Python Software 

Needless to say, this is part of what makes getting started a bit less straightforward than installing yelp on your phone (this workshop is not sponsored by Yelp).
